Panel specific properties calculated during the vortex lattice method analysis.

**Fields**

 - `velocity`: Local velocity at the panel's bound vortex center, normalized by
    the reference velocity

    calculated by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, normalized by the reference
    dynamic pressure and area

    calculated by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, normalized by the reference
    dynamic pressure and area

    excluding the induced velocity from the bound vorticies, not normalized
