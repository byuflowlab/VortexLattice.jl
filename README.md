*A Comprehensive Julia implementation of the Vortex Lattice Method*

Authors: Taylor McDonnell and Andrew Ning

**VortexLattice** is a comprehensive pure-Julia implementation of the vortex lattice method for both steady and unsteady flow conditions.  It is designed to be fast, accurate (within theoretical limitations), easy to use, and applicable to arbitrary geometries and velocity fields.  Its steady analysis capabilities have been extensively verified against results generated using AVL and its unsteady analysis capabilities have been verified against unsteady vortex lattice method results generated by Katz and Plotkin.

## Installation

Enter the package manager by typing `]` and then run the following:

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/byuflowlab/VortexLattice.jl
```

## Performance

This code has been optimized to be highly performant, primarily by maintaining type stability and minimizing allocations.  It should outperform vortex lattice method codes written in other higher level languages.  However, it does not yet incorporate the fast multipole method to speed up wake computations, so its performance can still be improved.

## Usage

See the [documentation](https://flow.byu.edu/VortexLattice.jl/dev)
