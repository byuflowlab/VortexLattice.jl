Compute the induced velocity from the grid of panels in `surface` at `rcp` using

# Keyword Arguments
 - `nc`: Number of panels in the chordwise direction. Defaults to `size(surface, 1)`
 - `ns`: Number of panels in the spanwise direction. Defaults to `size(surface, 2)`
 - `finite_core`: Flag indicating whether the finite core model should be used
 - `symmetric`: Flag indicating whether sending panels should be mirrored across the X-Z plane
 - `wake_shedding_locations`: Wake shedding locations for the trailing edge panels in `surface`
 - `trailing_vortices`: Indicates whether trailing vortices are used. Defaults to `true`.
 - `xhat`: Direction in which trailing vortices are shed if `trailing_vortices = true`.
    Defaults to [1, 0, 0]
 - `skip_leading_edge = false`: Indicates whether to skip the leading edge.  This flag
    may be used to skip calculating the leading bound vortex of a wake when its
    influence cancels exactly with the trailing bound vortex of a surface.
 - `skip_inside_edges = false`: Indicates whether to skip all horizontal bound
    vortices except those located at the leading and trailing edges.
    This flag may be used to skip calculating a wake's (internal) horizontal
    bound vortices during steady state simulations since the influence of adjacent
    wake panels in a chordwise strip cancels exactly in steady state simulations.
 - `skip_trailing_edge = false`: Indicates whether to skip the trailing edge.
    The trailing edge is always skipped if `trailing_vortices = true`
 - `skip_top`: Tuple containing panel indices whose top bound vortex is coincident with
    `rcp` and should therefore be skipped.
 - `skip_bottom`: Tuple containing panel indices whose bottom bound vortex is coincident with
    `rcp` and should therefore be skipped.
 - `skip_left`: Tuple containing panel indices whose left bound vortex is coincident with
    `rcp` and should therefore be skipped.
 - `skip_right`: Tuple containing panel indices whose right bound vortex is coincident with
    `rcp` and should therefore be skipped.
 - `skip_left_trailing`: Tuple containing panel indices whose left trailing vortex
    is coincident with `rcp` and should therefore be skipped.
 - `skip_right_trailing`: Tuple containing panel indices whose right trailing vortex
    is coincident with `rcp` and should therefore be skipped.
